        <h1>Pesto Salmon</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bright green basil pesto is a natural fit with baked fish! This pesto salmon is an easy weeknight meal that also works to impress guests.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets or a large 1 ½ pound fillet, wild caught if possible</li>
            <li>Olive oil, for brushing</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for brining</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons basil pesto (homemade preferable)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted and chopped pine nuts</li>
            <li>A few grates of lemon zest, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Brine the salmon: While the oven preheats, in a shallow dish stir together 4 cups room temperature water and 3 tablespoons kosher salt until it dissolves. Place the salmon in the water and wait for 15 minutes (this should be about the time it takes to preheat).</li>
            <li>Bake*: Rub the bottom of a baking dish with olive oil. Pat each piece of salmon dry and place it on the pan. Sprinkle the salmon with ⅛ teaspoon kosher salt for each of the 4 fillets and fresh ground pepper. Cover pan with foil and bake the salmon for 10 minutes. Then remove the foil bake again for 3 to 6 minutes, depending on thickness, until just tender and pink at the center (the internal temperature should be between 125 to 130 degrees Fahrenheit in the center). A 1-inch thick fillet should cook in about 15 minutes total.</li>
            <li>Serve: When the salmon is done, spoon the pesto over the salmon. Sprinkle it with chopped pine nuts and if desired, a bit of lemon zest. Serve immediately. (Leftovers can be stored refrigerated for 3 to 4 days.)</li>
        </ol>
