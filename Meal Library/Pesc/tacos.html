        <p>Here’s how to make the tastiest fish tacos around! Bake the fish with a dry rub of spices, then top it with tangy slaw and creamy sauce.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound tilapia or cod* (wild caught preferable)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon each cumin and smoked paprika (or standard paprika)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon each garlic powder and onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, for seasoning</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded red cabbage (or a mix of red and green cabbage)</li>
            <li>1 shredded or grated carrot (optional)</li>
            <li>1 green onion</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons lime juice</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon each celery salt and kosher salt (or all kosher salt)</li>
            <li>Fish Taco Sauce (or Cilantro Lime Crema, Spicy Mayo, or Chipotle Sauce)</li>
            <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
            <li>Chopped cilantro, for serving</li>
            <li>Lime wedges, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Thaw the fish, if necessary.</li>
            <li>Make the fish: In a small bowl, mix together the dry rub: chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder. Pat the fish dry, then sprinkle it with 1 teaspoon kosher salt and pat it in. Add the seasoning and pat it to cover the fish. Place the fish on a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, until tender. Then broil for 2 minutes until the top is lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Make the slaw: Meanwhile, thinly slice the cabbage. Shred or grate the carrot (we used a handheld julienne peeler). Thinly slice the green onion. Place the cabbage, carrots and green onion in a bowl. Stir in the lime juice, salt and celery salt. Serve immediately with a slotted spoon. The slaw picks up moisture as it sits; if you plan to let it sit, make sure to serve with the slotted spoon to strain out the moisture.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: Make the Fish Taco Sauce.</li>
            <li>Warm the tortillas: If desired, char the tortillas by placing them on an open gas flame on medium for a few seconds per side, flipping with tongs, until they are slightly blackened and warm. Or warm them according to How to Warm Tortillas.</li>
            <li>Assemble the tacos by topping the tortillas with fish, slaw, and sauce. Top with chopped cilantro and a spritz of lime. </li>
