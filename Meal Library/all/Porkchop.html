        <h1>Glazed Porkchops</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Do you ever see delicious-looking pork chop recipes in a magazine or scrolling through your instagram feed and think “Why don’t I cook with pork more often?” We’ve been there. It can be easy to get into the habit of rotating beef and chicken time and time again, but we are finally giving this “other white meat” the love it deserves and we are pretty sure we will never look back.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pork chops, boneless (about 2 lbs)</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 tsp ginger minced</li>
            <li>⅓ cup hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp water</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small sauce pan set over medium heat, simmer the garlic, ginger, hoisin, rice vinegar and water, whisking occasionally until the mixture is fully combined, about 4 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Lightly salt pork chops. Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over high heat. Once oil is smoking, place the pork chops in the skillet, cook without turning until well browned, 3-4 minutes on each side (adjust timing based on how thick your pork chop is). When an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 135°F, remove the pork chops from the pan. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with hoisin sauce drizzled over top.</li>
        </ol>
