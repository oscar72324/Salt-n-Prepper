        <h1>Brocolli Pesto Pasta</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the kind of recipe we’re leaning hard on right now. Pasta—everyone loves it. Cheese, garlic, olive oil—also things that everyone loves. Broccoli to make us feel good about ourselves. And best of all, it’s ready in about 15 minutes. </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb cooked pasta of your choice, pasta water reserved</li>
            <li>4 cups broccoli florets</li>
            <li>2 cups basil leaves, lightly packed</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>¼ cup pine nuts</li>
            <li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot bring water ** to a rapid boil.</li>
            <li>Add the broccoli, bring the water back up to a boil for two minutes. Do not drain the water! Immediately transfer broccoli (with a slotted spoon) to a colander place under cold running water to stop further cooking.</li>
            <li>Bring the water ** back to a boil and add your favorite pasta and cook according to the package (reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining).</li>
            <li>In a large blender or food processor, blend together broccoli, basil, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil, salt and Parmigiano-Reggiano until smooth. Slowly pour in 1 cup of reserved pasta water until a nice sauce is formed. If sauce is too thick, add more pasta water one tablespoon at a time.</li>
            <li>Toss hot pasta with sauce until completely coated. Top with extra Parmesan, pine nuts and chili flakes if desired. Enjoy!</li>
